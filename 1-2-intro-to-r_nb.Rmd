# Week 1, Class 2: Introduction to R and the Tidyverse

## Exercises

This lesson has a corresponding editable notebook containing some exercises. These are stored as a separate notebook in the CSC notebook workspace, with the name `1-2-intro-to-r.Rmd`. You'll need to move a copy to your 'my-work' folder in your CSC notebook Workspace, complete the exercises, and knit them, using the [method we learned in the previous class](https://comhis.github.io/applying-network-analysis-to-humanities/notebooks/1-1-introduction_nb.html). Once this is done, send a copy of the HTML file to the course leaders.

## R and R-Studio

Throughout this course, we'll mostly work on networks and data using the programming lanugage R and a popular extension known as 'the tidyverse'. This will be done using R-Studio, an interface designed to make R easier to work with, known as an IDE.

For this course, the data, files, and interface are all already set up for you in the CSC Notebooks workspace. In most cases, you will want to install R and R-Studio on your local machine. See here for instructions on how to do this.

### Logging into CSC notebooks and opening a notebook.

The first thing you should do is log in to CSC Notebooks, and start the RStudio application, [as explained in the previous chapter]. Once you've done this, and opened the relevant notebook, you'll see this screen (I've overlaid squares and numbers to refer to different parts).

R-Studio is divided into four different sections, or *panes*. Each of these also has multiple tabs. Starting from the top-left (numbered 1):

1.  The source editor. Here is where you can edit R files such as RMarkdown or scripts.

2.  The environment pane will display any objects you create or import here, along with basic information on their type and size.

3.  This pane has a number of tabs. The default is files, which will show all the files in the current folder. You can use this to import or export additional files to R-Studio from your local machine.

4.  The console allows you to type and execute R commands directly: do this by typing here and pressing return.

All four of these panes are important and worth it's worth exploring more of the buttons and menu items. Throughout this course, you'll complete exercises by using the source editor to edit notebooks. As you execute code in these notebooks, you'll see objects pop into the environment pane. The console can be useful to test code that you don't want to keep in a document. Lastly, getting to know how to use and navigate the directory structure using the files pane is essential.

## Using R

### 'Base' R.

Commands using R without needing any additional packages are often called 'base' R. Here are some important ones to know:

You can assign a value to an object using `=` or `->`:

```{r}
x = 1

y <- 4

```

You can do basic calculations with `+`, `-`, `*` and `/`:

```{r}
x = 1+1

y = 4 - 2

z = x * y

z
```

You can compare numbers or variables using `==` (equals), `>` (greater than), `<`, (less than) `!=` (not equal to). These return either `TRUE` or `FALSE`:

```{r}

1 == 1

x > y

x != z

```

### Basic R data types.

It is worth understanding the main types of data that you'll come across, in your environment window. First, you'll have dataframes. These are the spreadsheet-like objects which you'll use in most analyses. They have rows and columns.

Next are variables. A variable is assigned to a name, and then used for various purposes.

You'll often hear of an item called a vector. A vector is a list of objects of the same type. A vector can be a single column in a dataframe (spreadsheet), which means they are used very often in R to manipulate data. A vector can have different types: for example, a character vector looks like this `c("apples", "bananas", "oranges")`.

A vector is created with the command `c()`, with each item in the vector placed between the brackets, and followed by a comma. If your vector is a vector of words, the words need to be in inverted commas or quotation marks.

```{r}
fruit = c("apples", "bananas", "oranges", "apples")
colour = c("green", "yellow", "orange", "red")
amount = c(2,5,10,8)
```

You can create a dataframe using the `data.frame()` command. You just need to pass the function each of your vectors, which will become your columns.

```{r}
fruit_data = data.frame(fruit, colour, amount, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

Notice above that the third column, the amount, has <int> under it instead of <chr>. That's because R is treating it as a number, rather than a character. This means you can add them up and do all sorts of other mathy type things to them.

All the items in a vector are *coerced* to the same type. So if you try to make a vector with a combination of numbers and strings, the numbers will be converted to strings. I wouldn't worried *too* much about that for now.

So for example if you create this vector, the numbers will get converted into strings.

```{r}
fruit = c("apples", 5, "oranges", 3)
fruit
```

## Tidyverse

Most of the work in these notebooks is done using a set of packages developed for R called the 'tidyverse'. These enhance and improve a large range of R functions, with much nice syntax - and they're faster too. It's really a bunch of individual packages for sorting, filtering and plotting data frames. They can be divided into a number of diferent categories.

All these functions work in the same way. The first argument is the thing you want to operate on. This is nearly always a data frame. After come other arguments, which are often specific columns, or certain variables you want to do something with.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

Here are a couple of the most important ones

### select(), pull()

`select()` allows you to select columns. You can use names or numbers to pick the columns, and you can use a `-` sign to select everything *but* a given column.

Using the fruit data frame we created above: We can select just the fruit and colour columns:

```{r}
select(fruit_data, fruit, colour)
```

Select everything but the colour column:

```{r}
select(fruit_data, -colour)
```

Select the first two columns:

```{r}
select(fruit_data, 1:2)
```

### group_by(), tally(), summarise()

The next group of functions group things together and count them. Sounds boring but you would be amazed by how much of data science just seems to be doing those two things in various combinations.

`group_by()` puts rows with the same value in a column of your dataframe into a group. Once they're in a group, you can count them or summarise them by another variable.

First you need to create a new dataframe with the grouped fruit.

```{r}
grouped_fruit = group_by(fruit_data, fruit)
```

Next we use `tally()`. This counts all the instances of each fruit group.

```{r}
tally(grouped_fruit)
```

See? Now the apples are grouped together rather than being two separate rows, and there's a new column called `n`, which contains the result of the count.

If we specify that we want to count by something else, we can add that in as a 'weight', by adding `wt =` as an argument in the function.

```{r}
tally(grouped_fruit, wt = amount)
```

That counts the amounts of each fruit, ignoring the colour.

### filter()

Another quite obviously useful function. This filters the dataframe based on a condition which you set within the function. The first argument is the data to be filtered. The second is a condition (or multiple condition). The function will return every row where that condition is true.

Just red fruit:

```{r}
filter(fruit_data, colour == 'red')
```

Just fruit with at least 5 pieces:

```{r}
filter(fruit_data, amount >=5)
```

### sort(), arrange()

Another useful set of functions, often you want to sort things. The function `arrange()` does this very nicely. You specify the data frame, and the variable you would like to sort by.

```{r}
arrange(fruit_data, amount)
```

Sorting is ascending by default, but you can specify descending using `desc()`:

```{r}
arrange(fruit_data, desc(amount))
```

If you \`sort`arrange()` by a list of characters, you'll get alphabetical order:

```{r}
arrange(fruit_data, fruit)
```

You can sort by multiple things:

```{r}
arrange(fruit_data, fruit, desc(amount))
```

Notice that now red apples are first.

### left_join(), inner_join(), anti_join()

Another set of commands we'll use quite often in this course are the `join()` 'family'. Joins are a very powerful but simple way of selecting certain subsets of data, and adding information from multiple tables together.

Let's make a second table of information giving the delivery day for each fruit type:

```{r}

fruit_type = c('apples', 'bananas','oranges')
weekday = c('Monday', 'Wednesday', 'Friday')

fruit_days = data.frame(fruit_type, weekday, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

fruit_days

```

This can be 'joined' to the fruit information, to add the new data on the delivery day, without having to edit the original table (or repeat the information for apples twice). This is done using `left_join`.

Joins need a common `key`, a column which allows the join to match the data tables up. It's important that these are unique (a person's name makes a bad key by itself, for example, because it's likely more than one person will share the same name). Usually, we use codes as the join keys. If the columns containing the join keys have different names (as ours do), specify them using the syntax below:

```{r}

joined_fruit = fruit_data %>% left_join(fruit_days, by = c("fruit" = "fruit_type"))

joined_fruit

```

In this new dataframe, the correct weekday is now listed beside the relevant fruit type.

### Piping

Another useful feature of the tidyverse is that you can 'pipe' commands through a bunch of functions, making it easier to follow the logical order of the code. This means that you can do one operation, and pass the result to another operation. The previous dataframe is passed as the first argument of the next function by using the pipe `%>%` command. It works like this:

```{r}
fruit_data %>% 
  filter(colour != 'yellow') %>% # remove any yellow colour fruit
  group_by(fruit) %>% # group the fruit by type
  tally(amount) %>% # count each group
  arrange(desc(n)) # arrange in descending order of the count
```

That code block, written in prose: "take fruit data, remove any yellow colour fruit, count the fruits by type and amount, and arrange in descending order of the total"

### Plotting using ggplot()

The tidyverse includes a plotting library called `ggplot2`. To use it, first use the function `ggplot()` and specify the dataset you wish to graph using `data = `. Next, add what is known as a 'geom': a function which tells the package to represent the data using a particular geometric form (such as a bar, or a line). These functions begin with the standard form `geom_`.  

Within this geom, you'll add 'aesthetics', which specify to the package which part of the data needs to be mapped to which particular element of the geom. The most common ones include `x` and `y` for the x and y axes, `color` or `fill` to map colors in your plot to particular data. 

`ggplot` is an advanced package with many options and extensions, which cannot be covered here.


Some examples using the fruit data:

Bar chart of different types of fruit (one each of bananas and oranges, two types of apple)

```{r}
ggplot(data = fruit_data) + geom_col(aes(x = fruit, y = amount))
```

Counting the total amount of fruit:

```{r}
ggplot(fruit_data) + geom_col(aes(x = fruit, y = amount))
```

Charting amounts and fruit colours:

```{r}
ggplot(data = fruit_data) + geom_bar(aes(x = fruit, weight = amount, fill = colour)) 
```

## Reading in external data

Most of the time, you'll be working with external data sources. These most commonly come in the form of comma separated values (.csv) or tab separated values (.tsv). The tidyverse commands to read these are `read_csv()` and `read_tsv`. You can also use `read_delim()`, and specify the type of delimited using `delim = ','` or `delim = '/t`. The path to the file is given as a string to the argument `file=`.

```{r}

df = read_csv(file = 'sample_network.csv') # Read a .csv file as a network, specify the path to the file here.

df

```

Notice that each column has a data type beside it, either <chr> for text or <dbl> for numbers. This is important if you want to sort or run calculations on the data.
