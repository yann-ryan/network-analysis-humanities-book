# Week 7: Final Project

There are two stages to the final project:

-   In the final week of the course, either December 14 or 16, you'll be assigned a 10-minute presentation slot, where you should outline your progress so far, including your research question, datasets used, any problems you encountered (or think you might). This is a chance to get feedback from your peers and course leaders.

-   The final project itself is due on Friday, December 23.

## What should the final project look like?

The final project tasks you with using your network data and related data model to tackle an interesting research questions. The project should take the form of an R Markdown notebook, as you have learned to create in the first few weeks of the course. An R Markdown document is a format which allows you to combine text, chunks of code, and the output of those chunks. You'll write up this document and then turn it into a HTML page - a process known as 'knitting'.

### Practical steps

Gather your datasets and make sure they are available. If you use a 'non standard' dataset, export a copy of the final dataset used and include it along with the knitted HTML file and the original R Markdown.

### Project Aim

The aim is to communicate to a reader the value of your project and its implications. To do this, the project should take the form of 'literate programming', meaning that it should contain code, visualisations, derived data, and text - it should read not just as a piece of code and its output, but as a report and discussion on your findings. Interpretation and discussion is essential.

You can also include supplementary elements, for example data.

Include the original markdown, all data used, and the knitted html version.

Some examples of literate programming final projects

## R Markdown

We have already gone through R Markdown in detail, but it has a number of other features/packages you can use if you want to extend your final project. The packages [VisNetwork](https://datastorm-open.github.io/visNetwork/) and [Plotly](https://plotly.com/r/) allow you to include interactive visualisations within the report. The [DT](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/) package allows you to do the same for tables. These elements are not essential, but can help to communicate your results to the reader in some cases.

### Reproducible research

The point of this is that it allows anyone to reproduce your results. This is done by including your code and data within the report. This is done automatically if you use R Markdown, because the code is included by default in your outut. You can use external sources and code/applications, but you should explain what you have used in detail, so that others can follow the steps you've carried out and (hopefully) reach the same conclusions.

### Questions

Your final project should be structured to answer the following questions:

-   **Introduction** - what is your question/problem you're trying to solve?

-   **Datasets** - what datasets are you using? Where did you get them? Is it openly-available? Do they have missing data? Did you need to do pre-processing such as data harmonisation?

-   What is your **data model**? How does your data relate to itself?

-   **Method** - How did you create the network? What subset of your data did you use and why did you choose it? What additional information about your network (attributes) did you use?

-   What are the basic **network statistics** of this network? With your 'finished' network, how many nodes and edges are there? What is the density? Is it clustered or very dense?

-   Outline the particular **network methods** you used - community detection, centrality, global network metrics, others?

-   **Findings**. What are your conclusions? What has the data and network told you?

-   **Discussion**. What are the implications for this research/method? What does it tell us? What didn't work? What are the pitfalls of looking at your data like this? What else did you try that didn't work? Were you able to use visualisations successfully?

## Final Project Datasets

As well as the ESTC and Twitter datasets we have provided for the final project, you can use any network dataset you like. In every case, you should reflect critically on the dataset used, provide it in full for reproducibility, and make a note on what bias it might have and how this might affect your findings.

Almost any humanities data can be represented as a network - particularly bipartite. You should outline the dataset you intend on using during the final project presentation. Many of these datasets will require the extraction of structured data or cleaning before they are suitable for network analysis, so bear in mind the time and expertise that will take.

### Available datasets

Below are some other datasets or collections of datasets which might be useful. Important to note: don't just pick a dataset because you think it might make an interesting network graph. **Think of the research question you would like to tackle first.**

**Dataset collections:**

[Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html)

[UCIrvine Network Data Repository](https://networkdata.ics.uci.edu/)

**Correspondence data:**

[Willem I van Oranje-Nassau: letters and network in 1572](https://dataverse.nl/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.34894/ZSIKRI)

[Correspondence of Daniel van der Meulen (1554 - 1600)](https://github.com/jessesadler/dvdm-correspondence)

There is also another dataset of early modern correspondence available, from the State Papers - ask Yann for more details.

**Citation/Co-occurrence networks**

[Citation network on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathurinache/citation-network-dataset)

[Marvel Universe Social Network](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/csanhueza/the-marvel-universe-social-network) (a good example of a bimodal network, that should generally be projected to a unimodal one for analysis)

[Game of Thrones Books Character Network](https://github.com/mathbeveridge/asoiaf) (and [series](https://github.com/mathbeveridge/gameofthrones))

**Other cultural data:**

[Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) (for full texts)

[RECIRC Project](https://recirc.universityofgalway.ie/explore)(database of texts by female authors - individual searches can be exported as a .csv file for use in network analysis)

[Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) (as we used in a previous class)
