# About this Book

This book is intended to be read alongside the the "Applying Network
Analysis to Humanities' course at the University of Helsinki, beginning
November 2022.

[Course page on Studies
Service](https://studies.helsinki.fi/courses/cur/hy-opt-cur-2223-7c9cdedc-fc7b-4e66-b793-1dbe0db868b7)

There are two chapters for each week, one for each session. Browse
through the chapters using the menu to the left.

For most classes, there is an equivalent set of exercises. You'll
probably want to have this book at hand to complete them. They are
available as R markdown notebooks, using the CSC notebooks service.
You'll need a CSC account, and you'll be sent a join code at the
beginning of the course. If you don't have either of these things,
contact the [course leader](mailto:yann.ryan@helinki.fi).
